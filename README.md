# Challenge-7
## Overview
The first objective of this assignment was to create queries to find out and store the number of employees at Pewlett Hackard likely headed towards retirement by their birthdays and job titles as well as to get their last job titles. Also, the next objective was to create a query and find out which employees are available for mentorship.

## Results
- A substantial number of employees are on their way towards retirement, this amounts close to 15% of the total employees at Pewlett Hackard.

- The overwhelming majority of the retiring employees are in senior positions, roughly two-thirds.

- A significant portion of employees who are retiring have held two or more titles within the company.
- There are around 1500 employees eligible for mentorship roles who were born in 1965.

## Summary
There is a lot more information that could be gathered and questions that could be asked. One question would be, what is the proportion of younger employees that work at Pewlett Hackard and which age brackets do they fall in? A second question is, could we expand mentorship eligibility beyond a birthday and base it more on the 
amount of time spent at the company in order to ger more mentors? Since a considerable number of people are retiring, we might want to expand the number of mentors, as
well as see if we have enough younger and/or employees with a similar amount of experience that can replace these jobs. One query we could do is make one that separtes
employees by age ranges and then we would see how many fall into each category and then set the apporiate ones up possibly to move into more senior positions. Another 
query we could make would be to create some tables with birthdays close to 1965 and/or one with employees with earlier hiring dates, that way, we could have more mentors and mentees to help offset the large volume of senior positions going into retirement.
